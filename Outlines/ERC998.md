# ERC998 Outline
### Explaining the “why”
Hook: introduce the problem → assets can be very complex, just attributing an NFT like ERC721 to one sometimes cannot allow for all possible interactions with the asset
* Non-trivial use cases:
  * Property ownership
  * Supply chain management
* More trivial use cases:
  * Gift bundles
  * Gaming
Basic architecture of an ERC-988 token:
* Mapping to child contracts
* How ERC721 child contracts are managed vs. ERC20 child contracts
* Use analogies to describe the basic architecture and functionality
* Break down all of the essential potential capabilities within (briefly detail every new unique function in the smart contract for each type after displaying the code)
  * erc998erc721 top-down composable tokens that can transact and hold erc721 tokens
    * ReceivedChild event and how to transfer tokens to it
    * rootOwnerOf
    * rootOwnerOfChild
    * ownerOfChild
    * onERC721Received
    * transferChild
    * safeTransferChild
    * transferChildToParent
    * getChild
  * erc998erc20 top-down composable tokens that can transact and hold erc20 tokens
    * ReceivedERC20 event
    * tokenFallback
    * balanceOfERC20
    * transferERC20
    * transferERC223
    * getERC20
  * erc998erc721 bottom-up composable tokens that can be owned by erc721 tokens
    * TransferToParent and TransferFromParent events 
    * tokenOwnerOf
    * transferToParent
    * transferFromParent
    * transferAsChild
  * erc998erc20 bottom-up composable tokens (erc20 tokens) that can be owned by erc721 tokens
    * TransferToParent and TransferFromParent events
    * balanceOfToken
    * transferFromParentERC223

Wrap-up: “so what” implications, projection into the future
  * current implementations of the token
    * mokens
    * cryptorome
