# Proposal: Developing DApps with Go Ethereum SDK and Docker

- Isolated and repeatable environments.
- Strictly controlled dependencies.
  - Forces you to be explicit about your dependencies.
  - Forces you to consciously manage dependency versions.
  - Forces you to make sure that your application works in a pristine and neutral environment.
