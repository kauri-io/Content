# Learn to Build on Ethereum With Kauri

ðŸ˜±Wow! Well, that was ETHDenver, and we hope you had as much of a blast as we did. Hackers made over 120 submissions to Kauri, with only a handful of small issues experienced. We met many of you at our booth, ran out of merchandise in one morning, and had a LOT of valuable conversations with developers, beginners and experienced alike.

Thank you so much for all the support and kind words we received and hello ðŸ‘‹to all our new users and subscriber.
