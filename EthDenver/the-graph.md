# Query Blockchain Data with The Graph at ETHDenver

The Graph is a decentralized protocol for indexing and querying data from blockchains, starting with Ethereum. It makes it possible to query data that is difficult or impossible to query directly by using a GraphQL interface.

## Features

- Fast data access
- Compatible with any framework or tool that supports GraphQL
- Filters, pagination, sorting
- Subscriptions to data updates

## Prizes Offered

Unsure at time of writing, [keep an eye on the blog](https://medium.com/graphprotocol).

## Getting Started

```bash
sudo yarn global add @graphprotocol/graph-cli
```
