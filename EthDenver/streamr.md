# Sponsor Name

Streamr is creating an open source platform for the free and fair exchange of the worldâ€™s realtime data. Their blockchain-backed data Marketplace and powerful tools put your data back where it belongs.

## Features

- Categorized lists of public data streams
- Be rewarded for creating, hosting, or validating streams
- Data aggregation and filtering

## Getting Started

Streamr have a lot of projects in [their GitHub repositories](https://github.com/streamr-dev) that you might find useful, but the main starting point for experimenting with Streamr's platform is [their visual editor](https://www.streamr.com/canvas). With the editor you can drag and drop sources of data, processors, outputs, and the connections between them.

For those of you who would rather work with code, read [Streamr's API documentation](https://www.streamr.com/help/api). It offers many of the same features as the editor, but you can assemble in your own projects.

For practical tutorial content, try one of the [Streamr tutorials](https://streamrdev.com/docs/streamr-documentation/tutorials/).

Streamr have four team members at ETHDenver, with talks and workshops on the schedule, [read their blog post](https://medium.com/streamrblog/ethdenver-streamr-2019-8c3806b703cf) to find out more.
