## Submitting your Project

### Create an Account

You need Metamask to create content on Kauri, [add it to your browser first](https://metamask.io), and if you've not used Metamask before, [we have a tutorial to get you started](https://kauri.io/article/2a587f3962044515937a8105cfa1568c/v3/metamask-interact-with-ethereum-in-your-browser).

Set MetaMask to the "Rinkeby" network when using Kauri.

Click the _Sign In_ button beneath the profile picture in the top right, and click _Sign_ on the MetaMask popup to complete the process (this is not a transaction, and doesn't cost you any ETH).

While not required, adding profile details gives readers extra details about you, and adds a username to your articles. Kauri keeps your email address private, and we use it for notifications.

### Create Submission

On the [Kauri homepage](https://kauri.io), click the _SUBMIT PROJECT_ button in the "ETHDenver Submissions" section, or open the <https://kauri.io/write-article/ethdenver> link directly.

Fill out the template submission, leaving the headings as they are, and don't remove the "ETHDENVER-2019-SUBMISSION" tag below the heading. Feel free to add any other sections, sub sections or tags you need. Click _PUBLISH ARTICLE_ when you've finished, or save it as a draft if edits are still in progress.

### Eding Existing Submissions

You can make changes to your submission up until the Hackathon deadline, 8am Mountain Time on Sunday 2/17/2019. You can find your submission from your profile page, or in the [ETHDenver submissions collection](https://kauri.io/collection/5c5d8d27cc2d870001b6f741/ethdenver-2019-submissions).
