# REASONS FOR USING 3BOX CHATBOX PLUGINS

While there are endless possibilities for what you can build using the 3box chatbox plugins, here are a few reasons to get you started.

## Chatrooms
3box chatbox plugin will make it super simple to add scalable, high-volume chatrooms, site-wide chats, or even “trollboxes” to your Ethereum application.

## Disappearing messages
Since messages only exist in-memory between online peers, it would be easy to create an application where online users can exchange messages with each other that disappear when both go offline.

## Direct messages 
The3box chatbox plugin allows for users to post messages directly to another peer id or 3ID (DID), which means that you can potentially allow users in a ghost chatroom to direct message (DM) each other on the side.
