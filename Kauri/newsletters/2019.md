# It's (nearly) a wrap! üéâü•≥üëè

As we draw into the final week(s) of 2019, we thought it was due time to take a look back at what happened in Kauri land this year and celebrate our reader's favourite posts, and contributors.

Kauri team

## üéÅ But first, an early gift for our users‚Ä¶

Just in time for you to spend the holidays reading and writing, we released a large new update to kauri.io last week, here are a few features:

-   **Bookmarks** - Create private bookmarks of your favorite content and organize those into folders.
-   **External Links** - Add useful links that aren't written on kauri to help people find all the relevant content for a topic.
-   **Import content (beta)** - Your content is written somewhere else? We created a tool which helps you easily import content to kauri from any source.
-   **kauri.io** - We listened to our users and refreshed our platform to make it easier to read, write and curate content.

Find out more in our [help section](https://kauri.io/help).
