##### Step 2: Install netlify lambda

Install `netlify-lambda` as a dev dependency so we can access it with `npx`. This is a utility for building the lambda function and serving it locally so you can test your functions before deploying them.

```bash
yarn add netlify-lambda -D
# or
npm install netlify-lambda --save-dev
```

Now add a directory where your lambda functions will live. Let's call it `lambda` since that kind of makes sense.

```bash
mkdir lambda
```

And lets make a configuration `.toml` file for netlify so they know where our functions will be served from:

```bash
touch netlify.toml
```

Now add the name `functions` to our toml file which is where the functions will be served from after they've been build by the `netlify-lambda` tool:

```toml
[build]
  functions = "functions"
```

Let's make a dummy function to go in our lambda folder by creating a file called `helloworld.js`

```bash
touch ./lambda/helloworld.js
```

and fill the file with the boilerplate that netlify provides from their docs:

```javascript
exports.handler = function(event, context, callback) {
  callback(null, {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: "Hello, World"
  });
};
```

Here you can see that the file exports a function called handler. This is the same format that AWS uses for their lambda functions (because netlify is really just a fancy wrapper around AWS). If you have a lambda function you've used there, you can use it here, and if you have any advanced trouble shooting requests regarding these functions, you'll do better adding AWS to your query than "netlify".

Now let's run a local server so we can test our endpoint using the `netlify-lambda` utility:

```bash
$ npx netlify-lambda serve lambda
netlify-lambda: Starting server
Lambda server is listening on 9000
Hash: 47a70dc1b032c7c81a89
Version: webpack 4.27.1
Time: 745ms
Built at: 2018-12-13 18:52:53
        Asset      Size  Chunks             Chunk Names
helloworld.js  1.03 KiB       0  [emitted]  helloworld
Entrypoint helloworld = helloworld.js
[0] ./helloworld.js 129 bytes {0} [built]
```

This will build a new folder called `functions` where your `helloworld.js` file will get compiled and served from. It's accessible from port 9000 by default so you can visit it at `https://localhost:9000/helloworld`

Commit your code and push to your repo. Netlify should notice the push to master and auto-deploy it.

```bash
git add . && git commit -m 'Step 2: Install netlify lambda' && git push
```

You will now have access to a functions section on netlify where you can see that you have one helloworld function

And if the deploy is finished you should be able to access it at https://block-workshop.netlify.com/.netlify/functions/helloworld 

This is the deployed format for the functions so that there aren't any name conflicts with your current routing. This is pretty ugly though, we'll add some proxy rules later to make it look better on the real metadata endpoint.
