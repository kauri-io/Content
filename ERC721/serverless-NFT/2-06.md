##### Step 6: Add rarebits

Another popular NFT marketplace is rarebits. Let's check their API format to make sure we're adhering to what it expects as well.

```json
{
  "name": "Robot token #14",
  "image_url": "https://www.robotgame.com/images/14.png",
  "home_url": "https://www.robotgame.com/robots/14.html",
  "description": "This is the amazing Robot #14, please buy me!",
  "properties": [
    {"key": "generation", "value": 4, type: "integer"}, 
    {"key": "cooldown", "value": "slow", type: "string"}
  ],
  "tags": ["red","rare","fire"]
}
```

What do you know! It follows it's own spec! Now you can maybe see why it's important to maintain some flexibility around your metadata endpoint until we live in a world that has really settled on a standard that everyone uses and isn't just hosted on a lambda function on netlify somewhere 😜

Anyway let's add some info to our token so it adheres to rarebits as well

```javascript
exports.handler = function(event, context, callback) {
  const tokenId = event.queryStringParameters.tokenId
  const metadata =  {

    // both opensea and rarebits
    "name": "Token #" + tokenId, 
    "description": "This is a very basic NFT with token Id #" + tokenId,
      
    // opensea
    "external_url": "https://block-workshop.netlify.com/",
    // rarebits
    "home_url": "https://block-workshop.netlify.com/", 

    // opensea
    "image": "https://dummyimage.com/600x400/000/fff/&text=token%20" + tokenId, 
    // rarebits
    "image_url": "https://dummyimage.com/600x400/000/fff/&text=token%20" + tokenId, 

    // opensea
    "attributes": [ 
      {
        "trait_type": "zodiac", 
        "value": returnZodiac(tokenId)
      }
    ],
    // rarebits
    "properties": [ 
      {"key": "zodiac", "value": returnZodiac(tokenId), type: "string"}, 
    ],

    // rarebits
    "tags": ["cool","hot","mild"]
  } 
  callback(null, {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify(metadata)
  });
};
```

Now we have a nice and fat json object being returned

Commit your code and push to git / netlify

```bash
git add . && git commit -m 'Step 6: Add rarebits' && git push
```
