#### Part 2

##### Step 1: Make new netlify project

We're going to begin Part 2 by creating a website.

```bash
touch ./index.html && echo "hello world : )" > ./index.html
```

Great that's a beautiful website! Let's deploy it to the internet. First add it to your git repo and push to your origin:

```bash
git add . && git commit -m 'new website' && git push
```

Now go to netlify.com and register using your github/gitlab/bitbucket account. I'm going to use netlify for this because they have a nice all in one package for deploying sites from git, running a build process, adding SSL for custom domains and a simple method for adding lambda functions. They also have authentication and form handling, but i've never used those features. You could also use AWS (which is what netlify is doing) or google firebase for basically all the same thing.

We're going to create an API endpoint that will return the metadata for our NFT. I know what you're thinking, "isn't this an evil centralized solution??". Yes it is. Why? Because the alternative still sucks. Until we live in a world where I can expect my IPFS file to persist after I stop seeding it, and where I don't have to wait forever for the content anyway, we're going to have to use the current Internet infrastructure. If you look at any successful NFT project, they're already doing the same thing. The biggest NFT marketplace, opensea.io, caches all the NFT data they can find and serve it directly. This is because it's better than relying on decentralized solutions at this point. When the decentralized solutions are viable... TA DA, our NFT has an upgradeable metadata endpoint!

So until then we use The Internet.

Back to netlify, we allow them to have api access to our code so that they can deploy.

We find our repo and select it

We don't need to add a build command or a publish directory because our website is just that one `index.html` file and it's in the project root. You are probably already on `master` branch so that won't need to change (although netlify will auto-deploy each branch on a new domain if you want it to). So we just click "Deploy site".

You might want to change your site from `laughing-lalande-74167d` so you can click "Site settings" then scroll down to "Change site name". I'll change mine to `block-workshop` which will make it available at https://block-workshop.netlify.com once the deploy process is over. Since there isn't really much to the process it's probably already done and you can check your own site at your own deploy link.

If everything went well you should see this beautiful website:
