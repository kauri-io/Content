##### Step 1: Setup Environment

I'm using `node v9.11.2` and `yarn v1.7.0` for this. NPM and other versions of node should, work just a heads up ☝️

First off, make a new project folder somewhere:

```bash
mkdir ./workshop && cd ./workshop
```

Unbox truffle shavings and install your dependencies using `npx` (should be included with current version of npm).

```bash
npx truffle unbox okwme/truffle-shavings

yarn
# or
npm install
```

Create your  `.env` and open the project in your favorite editor in order to add your different network specific mnemonic phrases and Infura API key:

```bash
touch .env

code .
# or
atom .
```

```
TRUFFLE_MNEMONIC=buddy drum hawk truck taxi dish card medal sketch shallow intact stool
GANACHE_MNEMONIC=grid voyage cream cry fence load stove sort grief fuel room save
TESTNET_MNEMONIC=your mnemonic phrase that unlocks accounts with rinkenby balances
INFURA_API_KEY=y0uRiNfUr4k3y 
```

If you don't have an account with Rinkeby ETH you can use the account I made for this tutorial. Just be careful cause if you're using it at the same time as someone else and try to run transactions at the same time, there will be nonce collisions which will prevent some transactions from going through.

```
TESTNET_MNEMONIC=flash gravity sister tip question story slam square resemble intact require voyage
```

And you're welcome to use the Infura key I made for this workshop:

```
INFURA_API_KEY=85939c42711147b291a40dc3a77177f8
```

Make sure the boilerplate contracts compile, deploy and pass the dummy test locally and on rinkeby

```bash
$ yarn test
Using network 'test'.

Compiling ./contracts/Migrations.sol...
Compiling ./contracts/Sample.sol...
        Sample deployed at: 0x345cA3e014Aaf5dcA488057592ee47305D9B3e10


  Contract: Sample
        68922 - Deploy sample
        -----------------------
        68,922 - Total Gas
    Sample.sol
      ✓ should pass


  1 passing (171ms)
```

and just make sure our testnet account has gas let's try rinkeby

```bash
$ yarn test --network rinkeby
Using network 'rinkeby'.

Compiling ./contracts/Migrations.sol...
Compiling ./contracts/Sample.sol...
        Sample deployed at: 0x345cA3e014Aaf5dcA488057592ee47305D9B3e10


  Contract: Sample
        68922 - Deploy sample
        -----------------------
        68,922 - Total Gas
    Sample.sol
      ✓ should pass


  1 passing (171ms)
```

Create a new repo on github, gitlab or bitbucket and add our boilerplate

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m 'Step 1: Setup Environment'
git remote add origin git@github.com:{username}/{repo}.git
git push -u origin master
```
